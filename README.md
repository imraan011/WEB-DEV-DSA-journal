#About This Repository

This repository documents my continuous learning journey in Web Development and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA). It serves as a structured log of concepts I study, practice, and implement while building a strong foundation in software engineering.

On the web development side, the repository includes hands-on practice with core technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and progressively explores modern development practices, project structures, and real-world problem-solving approaches. Code samples focus on clarity, correctness, and gradual improvement rather than quick hacks.

Alongside web development, this repository also contains DSA implementations, covering fundamental topics like arrays, strings, recursion, searching, sorting, and problem-solving patterns. Each solution is written with an emphasis on understanding logic, time complexity, and optimization.

The purpose of this repository is not just to store code, but to track growth over time, reflect consistency, and demonstrate a disciplined learning approach. It represents my commitment to improving as a developer through regular practice, experimentation, and revision.

This repository will continue to evolve as I learn new technologies, refine my problem-solving skills, and work toward becoming a professional full-stack developer.
